Transaction Fee Estimator

        This JavaScript project estimates the transaction fee when sending money in Kenyan Shillings (KES). It uses a simple percentage-based fee with defined minimum and maximum limits.

        ## 💡 How It Works

        The script prompts the user to enter the amount they want to send. It then calculates the transaction fee based on a 1.5% rate, ensuring the fee stays within the set minimum (KES 10) and maximum (KES 70). The total amount to be debited is then displayed to the user via an alert and logged to the console.

        ## 🧮 Fee Calculation Rules

        - **Percentage fee**: 1.5% of the amount
        - **Minimum fee**: KES 10
        - **Maximum fee**: KES 70
